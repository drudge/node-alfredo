# Alfredo: A Node.js Module for Alfred Workflows

Alfredo's primary features include:

* Functions for finding your bundle ID, cache and storage paths, and query arguments.
* Functions for reading and writing JSON and plist files.
* A function to perform fuzzy searching operations.
* A class to simplify generating [feedback XML](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/5-generating-feedback-in-workflows/) for Alfred.


## Installation

    npm install alfredo


## Core Functions
These are intended to make some basic rote tasks easier and faster to code. alfredo defines the following functions:

* `alfredo.bundleSync()`  
    This function returns the bundle ID for your workflow by reading it from its `Info.plist` file.
* `alfredo.readPlistSync(path)`, `alfredo.writePlistSync(path, obj)`, `alfredo.readJSONSync(path)`, `alfredo.writeJSONSync(path, obj)`  
    These functions will read from and write to the plist or JSON files located at `path`.

## Feedback System
Alfredo uses a robust and complete implementation of Alfred's feedback system, generating and outputting the required XML for the attributes you specify. This breaks down into a class called `Item` and a function called `feedback`.

* `alfredo.Item(args)`  
    The `Item` class is initialized with an object of keys and values, and returns one `Item` which can then be passed to the `feedback` function. The following keys are currently understood by Alfredo and Alfred:

    + `title`: The title string to show in the feedback list.
    + `subtitle`: The subtitle string to show below the title.
    + `uid`: A unique identifier string for Alfred's sorting functions.
    + `valid`: Either `true`, `false`, or a string. Tells Alfred whether the item is actionable.
    + `autocomplete`: A string to autocomplete Alfred's query to when an invalid item is chosen.
    + `icon`: A path to an icon image, a path to a file, or a file type (default: `icon.png`).
    + `fileIcon`: If you wish to use a particular file's icon, set `icon` to its path and `fileIcon` to `true`.
    + `fileType`: If you wish to specify a type of file whose icon Alfred should use, set `icon` to the type and `fileType` to `True`.
    + `arg`: The argument to be passed as `{query}` if the item is valid and actioned. If it contains newlines, it will be passed as a separate XML key rather than an attribute of `<item></item>`.
    + `type`: Currently, can only be set to `file`, which tells Alfred to treat the result as a file.

    A nifty trick is to pass an object with some or all of `Alfredo.Item`'s keys and values into the initializer. So you could conceivably do this:

    ```js
    var i = alfredo.Item({
      title: "A Title", 
      subtitle: "This is only a test.", 
      uid: "alfredo-test", 
      valid: false
    })
    ```

* `Item.get()`  
    Returns the current values for the item in the following format. Primarily used with the `feedback()` function below.

    If `autocomplete` or `type` is set, that value will be added to the `"attrib"` dictionary, as will an `arg` that does not contain newlines.
* `Item.feedback()`, `alfredo.feedback(items)`  
    Takes either an individual item or a list of items for `items` and prints a UTF-8-encoded XML string for Alfred to interpret.


## Fuzzy Search
Alfredo's fuzzy search is powered by the [fuzzy-filter](https://github.com/stratuseditor/fuzzy-filter) node module by [DJG](https://github.com/sentientwaffle).

```js
alfredo.fuzzy(pattern, items, [options])
```

#### Parameters

    pattern - The fuzzy String to match against.
    items   - An Array of String.
    options - (optional)
            * pre         - String to insert before matching text.
            * post        - String to insert after matching text.
            * limit       - Integer maximum number of results.
            * separator   - String separator. Match against the last
                            section of the String by default.
            * ignorecase  - Boolean (default: true).
            * ignorespace - Boolean (default: true).
            * separate    - Boolean (default: false). If set to true, the
                            function returns an array of an array of strings,
                            where each array is
                            [beforeLastSeparator, afterLastSeparator].
                            If set, `separator` must also be passed.

Note: If `pre` is passed, you also have to pass `post` (and vice-versa).

#### Example

```js
alfredo.fuzzy("cs", ["cheese", "pickles", "crackers", "pirate attack", "cs!!"])
// => ["cs!!", "cheese", "crackers"]
```
   
## Keychain Interface
If your workflow needs to store a user's sensitive data, particularly a username--password pair, 
the safest way to do so is with the Mac OS X Keychain. The Keychain is normally an utter pain in 
the behind, but Alfredo makes working with it a breeze using the [node-keychain](https://github.com/drudge/node-keychain) module.

* `alfredo.keychain.getPasswordSync(opts)`  
    Searches the Keychain for an account matching the passed `opts.account` and `opts.service`, returning the password.
* `alfreo.keychain.setPasswordSync(opts)`
    Saves or changes the saved password for `opts.account` and `opts.service` to `opts.Password`.
* `alfredo.keychain.deletePasswordSync(opts)`
    Removes `opts.account` and `opts.service`'s password from the Keychain.
